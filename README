Make the compilation script executeable and then run it. Nothing is installed, it just 
spits out an executeable.

Alternatively, view the compilation script and run by-hand.

The source for astartest.cc is a how-to for using the library. There are two lines:

        #include "Utilities.h"

and

        final_path = AStar(....);

which are responsible for calling the routine. The rest is setting up the initial/final
points and printing the path to screen.



NOTE: You will need to have a unicode-happy terminal to see anything. Works on rxvt-unicode
(urxvt) and gnome-terminal. If this is inconvenient, just change the unicode marks in the
source of astartest.cc.

NOTE: I welcome patches, ideas, bug reporting, and criticism.
