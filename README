INSTALLATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make the compilation script executeable and then run it. Nothing is installed, it just 
 spits out an executeable. Alternatively, view the compilation script and run by-hand.

DESCRIPTIONS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program is a C++ implementation of the A* algorithm. It is probably not very fast, 
 but it is templated and easy to use. 

The source for astartest.cc is a simple how-to for using the library. There are two lines:
        #include "Utilities.h"
 and
        final_path = AStar(....);

 which are responsible for calling the routine. The rest is setting up the initial/final
 points and printing the path to screen. An even simpler version spits out the path in
 3d (astartest_3D.cc). 


The remaining astartest*  files give examples of how to pass in custom functions. Check
 Utilities.h for definitions, or to see how to define your own custom functions.

NOTES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The files Utilities.cc and Utilities.h are covered under the LGPLv3.0 (see the 
 LICENSE file.) The astartest* files and the compilation script are covered under the 
 GPLv3.0. This and other documentation (as distributed by the author) is covered under
 the FDLv3.0.

You will need to have a unicode-happy terminal to see anything. Works on rxvt-unicode
 (urxvt) and gnome-terminal. If this is inconvenient, just change the unicode marks in the
 source of astartest.cc.

I welcome patches, ideas, bug reporting, and criticism.
